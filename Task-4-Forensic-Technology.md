# Task 5 - Forensic Technology

For this task, I assisted in analysing and classifying data related to gender pay equality at Daikibo Industrials as a part of the Forensic Technology team. 
This investigation followed internal complaints about pay disparities and aimed to provide a clearer picture of the company's pay practices across locations and job roles.

## The steps taken are as follows:

* Understanding the Data
    - Reviewed the provided dataset (Equality Table.xlsx), which included columns for Factory, Job Role, and Equality Score.

* Familiarised myself with the scoring system:
    - Fair: Scores between -10 and +10.
    - Unfair: Scores outside the Fair range but within -20 to +20.
    - Highly Discriminative: Scores beyond -20 or +20.

* Adding the Classification Column
    - Created a 4th column, namig it `Equality Class ` to categorise each Equality Score based on the provided ranges

* Validating the Data
    - Cross-checked the classifications for a sample of rows to confirm the formula's correctness.
    - Ensured the final table was complete and ready for submission
 

This task was particularly impactful as it combined technical skills with real-world social implications. 
Using Excel to analyse and classify data allowed me to see how quantitative data could drive organisational change. The straightforward yet meaningful nature of the task made it both engaging and fulfillin
