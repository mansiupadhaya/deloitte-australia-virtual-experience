# âœ¨ Deloitte Australia Technology Job Simulation âœ¨

I recently completed Deloitte Australia's Technology Virtual Job Simulation on Forage (January 11, 2025), and it provided an excellent opportunity to experience what it's like to work on a technology team at Deloitte. During this program, I worked on tasks like reconciling data, creating dashboards, and advising a client on handling a data breach. This experience allowed me to build my data analysis skills in a practical, real-world context while working with tools such as Tableau and Excel.

## Skills Learned ðŸŒŸ

I appreciated how the tasks were structured as they helped me form a diverse set of skills. These include:

Unification of data formats: combining code into a unified format using Python
Analysing data: Reading web activity logs to inspect for suspicious requests
Visualising data: Analysing telemetry data using tools like Tableau
Soft skills: Writing a software development project proposal for a client in a formal and informative manner

I've finished this virtual experience program having learnt heaps about the role of technology in solving complex business challenges, and this has ultimately reinforced my foundational knowledge surrounding data-driven problem solving.
