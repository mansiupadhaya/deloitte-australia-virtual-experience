# Task 3 - Development

In this task, I was responsible for drafting a formal development proposal for a private dashboard project. The dashboard would display the health statuses of machines across Daikibo's four factories, with collapsible/expandable views and access restricted to the client's intranet.

## Steps Taken
* Understanding the Project Requirements
    - Reviewed the project details to understand the functionality, scope and client requirements, such as intranet-only access, authentication syncing, and device status visualisation

* Utilising the Proposal Template
    - Referred to the provided template to structure the proposal effectively.
    - The template outlined essential sections which was incredibly helpful as it was my first time writing a proposal.

* Drafting the Proposal
    - Overview: Wrote a concise introduction and high-level description of the dashboard project.
    - Scope: Detailed the core functionalities, such as the collapsible/expandable views and synced authentication.
    - Estimates: Broke down the total man-hours required for development, testing, and integration.
    - Timeline: Created milestones for each phase, fromm initial development to final delivery.
    - Support: Highlighted the availability of ongoing support for bug fixes, support tickets, and future enhancements.

* Final Review
    - Made sure the proposal was professional, aligned with the clientâ€™s requirements, and formatted clearly for easy comprehension.
  

I enjoyed stepping into a more formal writing role and appreciated the structured approach provided by the template, which helped guide me through the process ensuring that all necessary details were included
